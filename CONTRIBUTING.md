# Contributing Guidelines

Please make sure to use best practices in the codebase to ensure collaboration goes smoothly and everyone can stay on the same page. Expectations for code management are listed below. These guidelines apply to all code in XEON Protocol and should accompany every repository in the organization.

**Branching Strategy**

- Always create a new branch from `main` for any new feature or bug fix.
- Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the purpose of the branch (e.g., `feature/integrate-figma-ui-kit`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).

**Pull Requests (PRs)**

- Once you are done working on a branch, create a pull request to merge it back into `main`.
- Provide a clear and detailed description of the changes made in the PR.
- Assign reviewers to the PR and request a code review.
- Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.

**Code Reviews**

- Reviewers should provide constructive feedback and look for potential issues or improvements.
- Make sure to test the changes locally before approving the PR.
- Only approve PRs that meet our quality standards and follow our coding guidelines.

**Merging**

- Once the PR is approved and all checks pass, merge the branch into `main`.
- Use squash and merge to keep the commit history clean (unless the branch contains logically distinct commits that should be preserved).

**Maintaining a Clean Codebase**

- Regularly pull the latest changes from `main` into your working branches to avoid conflicts.
- After merging a branch, delete it to keep the repo clean.
- Document any significant changes or new features in our project documentation (README.md and associated files).

Always adhering to these will keep things running smoothly, reduce the risk of conflicts, and maintain high-quality and clean code.

**Additional Guidelines**

- **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that accurately describe the changes made. Use the imperative mood and present tense (e.g., "Fix bug in user authentication").
- **Coding Standards:** Follow our coding standards and style guides to ensure consistency across the codebase. Refer to the project's documentation for specific guidelines.
- **Testing:** Write and maintain unit and integration tests for all new features and bug fixes. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- **Documentation:** Keep the documentation up-to-date with any code changes. This includes comments within the code, as well as external documentation like the README.md and any additional guides.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure a collaborative and efficient workflow, maintain a high standard of code quality, and create a better product for our users. Thank you for your contributions!
