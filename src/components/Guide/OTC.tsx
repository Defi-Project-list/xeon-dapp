          ERC20 standard legacy support. This is a simple approach to a very
          basic need. The solution needed to be direct in addressing the issues
          investors face with risk management & unlocking liquidity from their
          ERC20 tokens.

          At the inception of this project, most developers were focused on
          bulding the most cutting edge new technology, whilst overlooking the
          opportunity to develop basic solutions for basic needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built the protocol from the ground up, customizing every function
          to create a powerful core, which we can then add new features onto by
          simply intergrating more smart contract modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          This simple approach to development enables us to leverage new
          technologies like AI in bulding more features into the protocol.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, leveraging AI smart contract protocols, we can enable
          users to write their custom functions using AI generators and
          implement them in their OTC trades. All this can be built on top of
          our core protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom made OTC solutions cover the basic fundamentals first, then
          evolve as new features are added on top of the base layer. Case in
          sight; Uniswap protocol in 2017, versus Uniswap protocol in 2024 and
          beyond.
